This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role\n * members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some\n * applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see\n * {AccessControlEnumerable}.\n *\n * Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed\n * in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by\n * using `public constant` hash digests:\n *\n * ```\n * bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\"MY_ROLE\");\n * ```\n *\n * Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a\n * function call, use {hasRole}:\n *\n * ```\n * function foo() public {\n *     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));\n *     ...\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and\n * {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only\n * accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}.\n *\n * By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means\n * that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other\n * roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using\n * {_setRoleAdmin}.\n *\n * WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to\n * grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure\n * accounts that have been granted it.\n */\nabstract contract AccessControl is Context, IAccessControl, ERC165 {\n    struct RoleData {\n        mapping(address => bool) members;\n        bytes32 adminRole;\n    }\n\n    mapping(bytes32 => RoleData) private _roles;\n\n    bytes32 public constant DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE = 0x00;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Modifier that checks that an account has a specific role.
